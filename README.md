# BlockCreator
Comment block automation for functions and classes in python

# Contributers
* @Joperezc

# Python Versions
* Tested on Python 3.10.6

# OS
* Tested on Linux/Ubuntu
* Mac/Windows not tested

# Required Libraries
* Prompt_Toolkit
* (Colorama if running test script)

# Goals
- [x] Add comment blocks to functions
- [x] Add comment blocks to Classes
- [x] Add comment blocks to ```if __name__ = __main__```
- [x] Add header comment block
- [ ] Add terminal interface for entering comments without having
  to go into IDE.
- [x] Correct indentation for comment blocks


# Instructions for Use
1. Run the script through the linux cmd
    * ```python3 commentBlockCreator.py (linux)```
      
2. Type in the file path for the python file
   you wish to add comments to or use tab completion
   
2.5. If using the test script as file path,
    some functions are purposefully over-indented
    to show comment block indentation.
    
# Known Bugs
* Conditionals in commentBlockCreator can lead to
  comment blocks being generated in those locations when
  running script on itself
